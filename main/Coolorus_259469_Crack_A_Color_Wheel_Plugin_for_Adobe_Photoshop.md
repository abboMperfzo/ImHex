Coolorus is not only a powerful tool for color selection, but also a great way to learn more about color theory and harmony. In this article, we will show you how to use Coolorus in Photoshop to create stunning digital paintings with ease and confidence.
 
First, you need to install Coolorus on your computer and activate it in Photoshop. You can download the installer from the official website of Coolorus and follow the instructions to install it. Then, you need to open Photoshop and go to Window > Extensions > Coolorus to enable the Coolorus panel. You can also customize the panel size, position and appearance by clicking on the gear icon at the top right corner of the panel.
 
Once you have Coolorus activated, you can start using it to pick colors for your painting. There are two main ways to do that: using the Color Wheel or using the Sliders & Mixers. The Color Wheel is a circular representation of colors that allows you to see the relationships between hues, saturation and brightness. You can use the cursor to select any color on the wheel, or use the keyboard shortcuts to adjust the hue (H), saturation (S) and brightness (B) values. You can also use the Color Schemes feature to automatically generate harmonious colors based on different modes, such as complementary, analogous, triadic and more. To access this feature, click on the icon at the bottom left corner of the panel and choose a mode from the drop-down menu. You will see four dots on the wheel that represent the colors of your scheme. You can drag them around to change their positions and see how they affect your color selection.
 
The Sliders & Mixers are another way to pick colors with Coolorus. They allow you to manipulate colors in different color spaces, such as RGB, HSV, LAB and more. You can access them by clicking on the icon at the bottom right corner of the panel and choosing a color space from the drop-down menu. You will see six sliders that correspond to the components of your chosen color space. You can drag them left or right to change their values and see how they affect your color selection. You can also use the Mixers feature to blend and store your picked colors in a palette. To access this feature, click on the icon at the top left corner of the panel and choose a mixer from the drop-down menu. You will see a grid of squares that represent your palette. You can drag any color from the wheel or sliders onto a square to store it, or drag two colors onto a square to blend them. You can also click on a square to select it as your current color.
 
One more feature that Coolorus offers is the Gamut Mask. This is a tool that helps you limit your color palette to a specific range of colors that work well together. To access this feature, click on the icon at the top right corner of the panel and choose a gamut mask from the drop-down menu. You will see a shape on the wheel that represents your gamut mask. You can drag it around to change its position and size, or use the keyboard shortcuts to rotate it (R) or flip it (F). You can also create your own custom gamut masks by clicking on the plus icon at the bottom of the menu. You will see a window where you can draw your own shape with bezier curves and save it as a new gamut mask.
 
Coolorus is a versatile and user-friendly plugin that can help you improve your color skills and choices in Photoshop. By using its features, you can create beautiful and harmonious color palettes for your digital paintings with ease and confidence.
