Nanny McPhee is not an ordinary nanny. She has a crooked nose, a snaggletooth, a mole, and a cane that she uses to perform magic. She also has a set of five rules that she teaches the children she cares for. The rules are: 1) To listen; 2) To do as they are told; 3) To go to bed when they are told; 4) To get up when they are told; and 5) To say please and thank you. As the children learn each rule, Nanny McPhee's appearance changes for the better, until she becomes beautiful and no longer needed.
  
In the first movie, Nanny McPhee arrives at the Brown household, where Mr. Brown is a widowed undertaker with seven children: Simon, Tora, Lily, Eric, Sebastian, Christianna, and Agatha. The children are notorious for driving away their nannies with their pranks and mischief. They also resent their father's attempts to marry a wealthy woman named Mrs. Quickly, who is cruel and greedy. Nanny McPhee uses her magic and wisdom to tame the children and help them bond with their father. She also helps Mr. Brown realize that he loves his cousin Evangeline, who works as a maid in the house. In the end, Mr. Brown marries Evangeline and inherits a fortune from his late aunt Adelaide, while Mrs. Quickly runs away with a soldier. Nanny McPhee leaves the family with a farewell gift: snow in August.
  
In the second movie, Nanny McPhee travels to the Green farm, where Mrs. Green is struggling to raise her three children: Norman, Megsie, and Vincent. Her husband is away fighting in the war, and her brother-in-law Phil is trying to sell the farm to pay off his gambling debts. The children are also at odds with their two spoiled cousins from London: Cyril and Celia Gray. Nanny McPhee introduces a new set of five lessons to the children: 1) To stop fighting; 2) To share; 3) To help each other; 4) To be brave; and 5) To have faith. Along the way, she enlists the help of some farm animals and a flying motorcycle. She also befriends Mr. Docherty, an elderly shopkeeper who knows her secret. In the end, Mrs. Green's husband returns safely from the war, Phil reforms his ways and finds love with Miss Topsey, a woman who collects things that people don't want, and Cyril and Celia reconcile with their father, Lord Gray, who is revealed to be Nanny McPhee's employer and Mr. Docherty's son. Nanny McPhee leaves the family with a farewell gift: a baby elephant.
